Amazon's product review averages are deceptive.  They use a machine-learned model without providing the details of the weighting, which is not transparent.  It seems to agressively dismiss older reviews and place superficial emphasis on "verified purchases".

The end result appears to be that some products (including Amazon partners) are rated higher than what customers actually rate them.

This Chrome Extension loads when you open an Amazon product page, calculating and displaying the true raw average of the reviews.

## Example

Consider the following Xfinity offering.

````
5 star: 8%
4 star: 2%
3 star: 1%
2 star: 2%
1 star: 87%
````

Amazon's reported rating: ````3.8/5 stars````

Actual average: ````((5*8)+(4*2)+(3*1)+(2*2)+(1*87))/100 = 142/100 = 1.4/5 stars````

Amazon reports a rating 2.4 stars higher than actually reflected by reviews.

## Amazon's excuse
![Machine-learned Model](machine-learning-model.png)

````"Amazon calculates a productâ€™s star ratings using a machine learned model instead of a raw data average. The machine learned model takes into account factors including: the age of a review, helpfulness votes by customers and whether the reviews are from verified purchases."````
